In a typical binary unit commitment formulation, each unit is either on or off. With the clustered unit commitment formulation, one or more cluster(s) of similar generators are clustered by type and zone (typically using heat rate and fixed O\\&M cost to create clusters), and the integer commitment state variable for each cluster varies from zero to the number of units in the cluster, fracDelta^total_yzOmega^size_yz. As discussed in \\cite{Palmintier2014}, this approach replaces the large set of binary commitment decisions and associated constraints, which scale directly with the number of individual units, with a smaller set of integer commitment states and  constraints, one for each cluster y. The dimensionality of the problem thus scales with the number of units of a given type in each zone, rather than by the number of discrete units, significantly improving computational efficiency. However, this method entails the simplifying assumption that all clustered units have identical parameters (e.g., capacity size, ramp rates, heat rate) and that all committed units in a given time step t are operating at the same power output per unit.\n\nPower balance expression\n\nThis function adds the sum of power generation from thermal units subject to unit commitment (Theta_y in UCt in Tz in Z) to the power balance expression.\n\nStartup and shutdown events (thermal plant cycling)\n\nCapacitated limits on unit commitment decision variables\n\nThermal resources subject to unit commitment (y in mathcalUC) adhere to the following constraints on commitment states, startup events, and shutdown events, which limit each decision to be no greater than the maximum number of discrete units installed (as per the following three constraints):\n\nbeginaligned\nnu_yzt leq fracDelta^texttotal_yzOmega^size_yz\n\thspace15cm forall y in mathcalUC forall z in mathcalZ forall t in mathcalT\nendaligned\n\nbeginaligned\nchi_yzt leq fracDelta^texttotal_yzOmega^size_yz\n\thspace15cm forall y in mathcalUC forall z in mathcalZ forall t in mathcalT\nendaligned\n\nbeginaligned\nzeta_yzt leq fracDelta^texttotal_yzOmega^size_yz\n\thspace15cm forall y in mathcalUC forall z in mathcalZ forall t in mathcalT\nendaligned\n\n(See Constraints 1-3 in the code)\n\nwhere decision nu_yzt designates the commitment state of generator cluster y in zone z at time t, decision chi_yzt represents number of startup decisions, decision zeta_yzt represents number of shutdown decisions, Delta^texttotal_yz is the total installed capacity, and parameter Omega^size_yz is the unit size.\n\nCommitment state constraint linking start-up and shut-down decisions\n\nAdditionally, the following constarint maintains the commitment state variable across time, nu_yzt, as the sum of the commitment state in the prior, nu_yzt-1, period plus the number of units started in the current period, chi_yzt, less the number of units shut down in the current period, zeta_yzt:\n\nbeginaligned\nnu_yzt =nu_yzt-1 + chi_yzt - zeta_yzt\n\thspace15cm forall y in mathcalUC forall z in mathcalZ forall t in mathcalT^interior \nnu_yzt =nu_yzt +tau^period-1 + chi_yzt - zeta_yzt\n\thspace15cm forall y in mathcalUC forall z in mathcalZ forall t in mathcalT^start\nendaligned\n\n(See Constraint 4 in the code)\n\nLike other time-coupling constraints, this constraint wraps around to link the commitment state in the first time step of the year (or each representative period), t in mathcalT^start, to the last time step of the year (or each representative period), t+tau^period-1.\n\nRamping constraints\n\nThermal resources subject to unit commitment (y in UC) adhere to the following ramping constraints on hourly changes in power output:\n\nbeginaligned\n\tTheta_yzt-1 + f_y z t-1+r_y z t-1 - Theta_yzt-f_y z tleq  kappa^down_yz cdot Omega^size_yz cdot (nu_yzt - chi_yzt)  6pt\n\tqquad  -  rho^min_yz cdot Omega^size_yz cdot chi_yzt  hspace05cm forall y in mathcalUC forall z in mathcalZ forall t in mathcalT  6pt\n\tqquad  +  textmin( rho^max_yzt textmax( rho^min_yz kappa^down_yz ) ) cdot Omega^size_yz cdot zeta_yzt \nendaligned\n\nbeginaligned\n\tTheta_yzt+f_y z t+r_y z t - Theta_yzt-1- f_y z t-1 leq  kappa^up_yz cdot Omega^size_yz cdot (nu_yzt - chi_yzt)  6pt\n\tqquad  +  textmin( rho^max_yzt textmax( rho^min_yz kappa^up_yz ) ) cdot Omega^size_yz cdot chi_yzt  hspace05cm forall y in mathcalUC forall z in mathcalZ forall t in mathcalT 6pt\n\tqquad  -  rho^min_yz cdot Omega^size_yz cdot zeta_yzt \nendaligned\n\n(See Constraints 5-6 in the code)\n\nwhere decision Theta_yzt, f_y z t, and r_y z t are respectively, the energy injected into the grid, regulation, and reserve by technology y in zone z at time t, parameter kappa_yzt^updown is the maximum ramp-up or ramp-down rate as a percentage of installed capacity, parameter rho_yz^min is the minimum stable power output per unit of installed capacity, and parameter rho_yzt^max is the maximum available generation per unit of installed capacity. These constraints account for the ramping limits for committed (online) units as well as faster changes in power enabled by units starting or shutting down in the current time step.\n\nMinimum and maximum power output\n\nIf not modeling regulation and spinning reserves, thermal resources subject to unit commitment adhere to the following constraints that ensure power output does not exceed minimum and maximum feasible levels:\n\nbeginaligned\n\tTheta_yzt geq rho^min_yz times Omega^size_yz times nu_yzt\n\thspace15cm forall y in mathcalUC forall z in mathcalZ forall t in mathcalT\nendaligned\n\nbeginaligned\n\tTheta_yzt leq rho^max_yz times Omega^size_yz times nu_yzt\n\thspace15cm forall y in mathcalUC forall z in mathcalZ forall t in mathcalT\nendaligned\n\n(See Constraints 7-8 the code)\n\nIf modeling reserves and regulation, these constraints are replaced by those established in this thermal_commit_reserves().\n\nMinimum and maximum up and down time\n\nThermal resources subject to unit commitment adhere to the following constraints on the minimum time steps after start-up before a unit can shutdown again (minimum up time) and the minimum time steps after shut-down before a unit can start-up again (minimum down time):\n\nbeginaligned\n\tnu_yzt geq displaystyle sum_hatt = t-(tau^up_yz-1)^t chi_yzhatt\n\thspace15cm forall y in mathcalUC forall z in mathcalZ forall t in mathcalT\nendaligned\n\nbeginaligned\n\tfracoverlineDelta_yz + Omega_yz - Delta_yzOmega^size_yz -  nu_yzt geq displaystyle sum_hatt = t-(tau^down_yz-1)^t zeta_yzhatt\n\thspace15cm forall y in mathcalUC forall z in mathcalZ forall t in mathcalT\nendaligned\n\n(See Constraints 9-10 in the code)\n\nwhere tau_yz^updown is the minimum up or down time for units in generating cluster y in zone z.\n\nLike with the ramping constraints, the minimum up and down constraint time also wrap around from the start of each time period to the end of each period. It is recommended that users of GenX must use longer subperiods than the longest min up/down time if modeling UC. Otherwise, the model will report error.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"thermal_commit.html#GenX.thermal_commit_reserves!-Tuple{JuMP.Model, Dict}","page":"Thermal Commit","title":"GenX.thermal_commit_reserves!","text":"thermal_commit_reserves!(EP::Model, inputs::Dict)\n\nThis function is called by the thermal_commit() function when regulation and reserves constraints are active and defines reserve related constraints for thermal power plants subject to unit commitment constraints on power plant start-ups and shut-down decisions.\n\nMaximum contributions to frequency regulation and reserves\n\nWhen modeling frequency regulation and reserves contributions, thermal units subject to unit commitment adhere to the following constraints which limit the maximum contribution to regulation and reserves in each time step to a specified maximum fraction (upsilon^rsv_yz) of the commitment capacity in that time step ((Omega^size_yz cdot nu_yzt)):\n\nbeginaligned\n\tf_yzt leq upsilon^reg_yz times rho^max_yzt (Omega^size_yz times nu_yzt) hspace15cm forall y in mathcalUC forall z in mathcalZ forall t in mathcalT\nendaligned\n\nbeginaligned\n\tr_yzt leq upsilon^rsv_yz times rho^max_yzt (Omega^size_yz times nu_yzt) hspace15cm forall y in mathcalUC forall z in mathcalZ forall t in mathcalT\nendaligned\n\nwhere f_yzt is the frequency regulation contribution limited by the maximum regulation contribution upsilon^reg_yz, and r_yzt is the reserves contribution limited by the maximum reserves contribution upsilon^rsv_yz.

This algorithm was developed by Brill Jr, E. D., 1979 and introduced to energy system planning by DeCarolia, J. F., 2011.\n\nTo create the MGA formulation, we replace the cost-minimizing objective function of GenX with a new objective function that creates multiple generation portfolios by zone. We further add a new budget constraint based on the optimal objective function value f^* of the least-cost model and the user-specified value of slack delta. After adding the slack constraint, the resulting MGA formulation is given as:\n\nbeginaligned\n\ttextmaxmin quad\n\tsum_z in mathcalZsum_r in mathcalR beta_zr^kP_zr\n\ttextst quad\n\tP_zr = sum_y in mathcalGsum_t in mathcalT omega_t Theta_ytzr  \n\t f leq f^* + delta \n\tAx = b\nendaligned\n\nwhere, beta_zr is a random objective fucntion coefficient betwen 0100 for MGA iteration k. Theta_ytzr is a generation of technology y in zone z in time period t that belongs to a resource type r. We aggregate Theta_ytzr into a new variable P_zr that represents total generation from technology type r in a zone z. In the second constraint above, delta denote the increase in budget from the least-cost solution and f represents the expression for the total system cost. The constraint Ax = b represents all other constraints in the power system model.

As such, the Method of Morris generates a grid of uncertain model input parameters, x_i i=1  k,, where the range x_i^- x_i^+ of each uncertain input parameter i is split into l intervals of equal length. Each trajectory starts at different realizations of input parameters chosen at random and are built by successively selecting one of the inputs randomly and moving it to an adjacent level. These trajectories are used to estimate the mean and the standard deviation of each input parameter on total system cost. A high estimated mean indicates that the input parameter is important; a high estimated standard deviation indicates important interactions between that input parameter and other inputs.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"methods.html#Methods","page":"Methods","title":"Methods","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"methods.html#Time-Domain-Reduction-(TDR)","page":"Methods","title":"Time Domain Reduction (TDR)","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"methods.html","page":"Methods","title":"Methods","text":"Rather than modeling and optimizing power grid operations at a high temporal resolution (e.g., hourly, over a full year) while evaluating new capacity investments, which can be computationally expensive for large-scale studies with several resources, it may be useful to consider a reduced temporal resolution to model annual grid operations.

Storage inventory balance at beginning of each representative period The constraints in this section are used to approximate the behavior of long-duration energy storage technologies when approximating annual grid operations by modeling operations over representative periods. Previously, the state of charge balance for storage (as defined in storage_all()) assumed that state of charge at the beginning and end of each representative period has to be the same. In other words, the amount of energy built up or consumed by storage technology o in zone z over the representative period m, Delta Q_ozm = 0. This assumption implicitly excludes the possibility of transferring energy from one representative period to the other which could be cost-optimal when the capital cost of energy storage capacity is relatively small. To model long-duration energy storage using representative periods, we replace the state of charge equation, such that the first term on the right hand side accounts for change in storage inventory associated with representative period m (Delta Q_ozm), which could be positive (net accumulation) or negative (net reduction).\n\nbeginaligned\n Gamma_oz(m-1)times tau^period+1  =left(1-eta_oz^lossright)times left(Gamma_ozmtimes tau^period -Delta Q_ozmright) -  \n frac1eta_oz^dischargeTheta_oz(m-1)times tau^period+1 + eta_oz^chargePi_oz(m-1)times tau^period+1 quad forall o in mathcalO^LDES z in mathcalZ m in mathcalM\nendaligned\n\nBy definition mathcalT^start=left(m-1right) times tau^period+1  m in mathcalM, which implies that this constraint is defined for all values of t in T^start. Storage inventory change input periods We need additional variables and constraints to approximate energy exchange between representative periods, while accounting for their chronological occurence in the original input time series data and the possibility that two representative periods may not be adjacent to each other (see Figure below). To implement this, we introduce a new variable Q_oz n that models inventory of storage technology o in O in zone z in each input period n in mathcalN. Additionally we define a function mapping, f n rightarrow m, that uniquely maps each input period n to its corresponding representative period m. This mapping is available as an output of the process used to identify representative periods (E.g. k-means clustering Mallapragada et al., 2018). (Image: Modeling inter-period energy exchange via long-duration storage when using representative period temporal resolution to approximate annual grid operations) Figure. Modeling inter-period energy exchange via long-duration storage when using representative period temporal resolution to approximate annual grid operations The following two equations define the storage inventory at the beginning of each input period n+1 as the sum of storage inventory at begining of previous input period n plus change in storage inventory for that period. The latter is approximated by the change in storage inventory in the corresponding representative period, identified per the mapping f(n).  The second constraint relates the storage level of the last input period, N, with the storage level at the beginning of the first input period. Finally, if the input period is also a representative period, then a third constraint enforces that initial storage level estimated by the intra-period storage balance constraint should equal the initial storage level estimated from the inter-period storage balance constraints. Note that N refers to the last modeled period.\n\nbeginaligned\n Q_ozn+1 = Q_ozn + Delta Q_ozf(n)\nquad forall  o in mathcalO^LDES z in mathcalZ n in mathcalNsetminusN\nendaligned\n\nbeginaligned\n Q_oz1 = Q_ozN + Delta Q_ozf(N)\nquad forall  o in mathcalO^LDES z in mathcalZ n = N\nendaligned\n\nbeginaligned\n Q_ozn =Gamma_ozf(n)times tau^period - Delta Q_ozm\nquad forall  o in mathcalO^LDES z in mathcalZ n in   mathcalN^rep\nendaligned\n\nFinally, the next constraint enforces that the initial storage level for each input period n must be less than the installed energy capacity limit. This constraint ensures that installed energy storage capacity is consistent with the state of charge during both the operational time periods t during each sample period m as well as at the start of each chronologically ordered input period n in the full annual time series.\n\nbeginaligned\n    Q_ozn leq Delta^total energy_oz\nquad forall n in mathcalN o in mathcalO^LDES\nendaligned\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"configure_multi_stage_inputs.html#configure-multi-stage-inputs","page":"Configure multi-stage inputs","title":"configure multi stage inputs","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"configure_multi_stage_inputs.html","page":"Configure multi-stage inputs","title":"Configure multi-stage inputs","text":"Modules = [GenX]\nPages = [\"configure_multi_stage_inputs.jl\"]","category":"page"},{"location":"configure_multi_stage_inputs.html#GenX.compute_overnight_capital_cost-Tuple{Dict, Array, Array, Array}","page":"Configure multi-stage inputs","title":"GenX.compute_overnight_capital_cost","text":"function compute_overnight_capital_cost(settings_d::Dict,inv_costs_yr::Array,crp::Array,tech_wacc::Array)\n\nThis function computes overnight capital costs incured within the model horizon, assuming that annualized costs to be paid after the model horizon are fully recoverable, and so are not included in the cost computation.\n\nFor each resource y in mathcalG with annualized investment cost AIC_y and capital recovery period CRP_y, overnight capital costs OCC_y are computed as follows:\n\nbeginaligned\n     OCC_y = sum^min(CRP_yH)_i=1fracAIC_y(1+WACC_y)^i\nendaligned\n\nwhere WACC_y is the technology-specific weighted average cost of capital (set by the \"WACC\" field in the Generators_data.csv or Network.csv files), H is the number of years remaining between the start of the current model stage and the model horizon (the end of the final model stage) and CRP_y is the capital recovery period for technology y (specified in Generators_data.csv).\n\ninputs:\n\nsettings_d - dict object containing settings dictionary configured in the multi-stage settings file multi_stage_settings.yml.\ninv_costs_yr - array object containing annualized investment costs.\ncrp - array object of capital recovery period values.\ntech_wacc - array object containing technology-specific weighted costs of capital.\n\nNOTE: The inv_costs_yr and crp arrays must be the same length; values with the same index in each array correspond to the same resource y in mathcalG.\n\nreturns: array object containing overnight capital costs, the discounted sum of annual investment costs incured within the model horizon.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"configure_multi_stage_inputs.html#GenX.configure_multi_stage_inputs-Tuple{Dict, Dict, Int64}","page":"Configure multi-stage inputs","title":"GenX.configure_multi_stage_inputs","text":"function configure_multi_stage_inputs(inputs_d::Dict, settings_d::Dict, NetworkExpansion::Int64)\n\nThis function overwrites input parameters read in via the load_inputs() method for proper configuration of multi-stage modeling:\n\nOvernight capital costs are computed via the compute_overnight_capital_cost() method and overwrite internal model representations of annualized investment costs.\nAnnualized fixed O&M costs are scaled up to represent total fixed O&M incured over the length of each model stage (specified by \"StageLength\" field in multi_stage_settings.yml).\nInternal set representations of resources eligible for capacity retirements are overwritten to ensure compatability with multi-stage modeling.\nWhen NetworkExpansion is active and there are multiple model zones, parameters related to transmission and network expansion are updated.

As implemented, flexible demand resources (y in mathcalDF) are characterized by: a) maximum deferrable demand as a fraction of available capacity in a particular time step t, rho^max_yzt, b) the maximum time this demand can be advanced and delayed, defined by parameters, tau^advance_yz and tau^delay_yz, respectively and c) the energy losses associated with shifting demand, eta_yz^dflex. Tracking total deferred demand The operational constraints governing flexible demand resources are as follows. The first two constraints model keep track of inventory of deferred demand in each time step.  Specifically, the amount of deferred demand remaining to be served (Gamma_yzt) depends on the amount in the previous time step minus the served demand during time step t (Theta_yzt) while accounting for energy losses associated with demand flexibility, plus the demand that has been deferred during the current time step (Pi_yzt). Note that variable Gamma_yzt in mathbbR, forall y in mathcalDF t  in mathcalT.

Previously, the state of charge balance for storage (as defined in storage_all()) assumed that state of charge at the beginning and end of each representative period has to be the same. In other words, the amount of energy built up or consumed by storage technology o in zone z over the representative period m, Delta Q_ozm = 0. This assumption implicitly excludes the possibility of transferring energy from one representative period to the other which could be cost-optimal when the capital cost of energy storage capacity is relatively small. To model long-duration energy storage using representative periods, we replace the state of charge equation, such that the first term on the right hand side accounts for change in storage inventory associated with representative period m (Delta Q_ozm), which could be positive (net accumulation) or negative (net reduction).\n\nbeginaligned\n Gamma_oz(m-1)times tau^period+1  =left(1-eta_oz^lossright)times left(Gamma_ozmtimes tau^period -Delta Q_ozmright) -  \n frac1eta_oz^dischargeTheta_oz(m-1)times tau^period+1 + eta_oz^chargePi_oz(m-1)times tau^period+1 quad forall o in mathcalO^LDES z in mathcalZ m in mathcalM\nendaligned\n\nBy definition mathcalT^start=left(m-1right) times tau^period+1  m in mathcalM, which implies that this constraint is defined for all values of t in T^start.\n\nStorage inventory change input periods\n\nWe need additional variables and constraints to approximate energy exchange between representative periods, while accounting for their chronological occurence in the original input time series data and the possibility that two representative periods may not be adjacent to each other (see Figure below). To implement this, we introduce a new variable Q_oz n that models inventory of storage technology o in O in zone z in each input period n in mathcalN. Additionally we define a function mapping, f n rightarrow m, that uniquely maps each input period n to its corresponding representative period m. This mapping is available as an output of the process used to identify representative periods (E.g. k-means clustering Mallapragada et al., 2018).\n\n(Image: Modeling inter-period energy exchange via long-duration storage when using representative period temporal resolution to approximate annual grid operations) Figure. Modeling inter-period energy exchange via long-duration storage when using representative period temporal resolution to approximate annual grid operations\n\nThe following two equations define the storage inventory at the beginning of each input period n+1 as the sum of storage inventory at begining of previous input period n plus change in storage inventory for that period. The latter is approximated by the change in storage inventory in the corresponding representative period, identified per the mapping f(n). If the input period is also a representative period, then a second constraint enforces that initial storage level estimated by the intra-period storage balance constraint should equal the initial storage level estimated from the inter-period storage balance constraints.\n\nbeginaligned\n Q_ozn+1 = Q_ozn + Delta Q_ozf(n)\nquad forall  o in mathcalO^LDES z in mathcalZ n in mathcalN\nendaligned\n\nbeginaligned\n Q_ozn =Gamma_ozf(n)times tau^period - Delta Q_ozm\nquad forall  o in mathcalO^LDES z in mathcalZ n in   mathcalN^rep\nendaligned\n\nFinally, the next constraint enforces that the initial storage level for each input period n must be less than the installed energy capacity limit. This constraint ensures that installed energy storage capacity is consistent with the state of charge during both the operational time periods t during each sample period m as well as at the start of each chronologically ordered input period n in the full annual time series.\n\nbeginaligned\n    Q_ozn leq Delta^total energy_oz\nquad forall n in mathcalN o in mathcalO^LDES\nendaligned\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"multi_stage_model_overview.html#Multi-stage-modeling-overview","page":"Multi-stage Model","title":"Multi-stage modeling overview","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"multi_stage_model_overview.html","page":"Multi-stage Model","title":"Multi-stage Model","text":"This section describes the available features, inputs and model components related to formulating and solving multi-stage investment planning problems.

Power output in each time step For each VRE technology type y and model zone z, the model allows for incorporating multiple bins with different parameters for resource quality (rho^max_yzt), maximum availability (overlineOmega_yz) and investment cost (Pi^INVEST_yz, for example, due to interconnection cost differences).

We define capacity reserve margin constraint for subsets of zones,z  in mathcalZ^CRM_p, and each subset stands for a locational deliverability area (LDA) or a reserve sharing group.  For thermal resources, the available capacity is the total capacity in the LDA derated by the outage rate, epsilon_yzp^CRM. For storage (y in mathcalO), variable renewable energy (y in mathcalVRE), and  flexibile demand resources (y in mathcalDF), the available capacity is the net injection into the transmission network in time step t derated by the derating factor, also stored in the parameter, epsilon_yzp^CRM. If the imported capacity is eligible to provide capacity to the CRM constraint, the inbound powerflow on all lines mathcalL_p^in in time step t will be derated to form the available capacity from outside of the LDA. The reverse is true as well: the outbound derated powerflow on all lines mathcalL_p^out in time step t is taken out from the total available capacity. The derating factor should be equal to the expected availability of the resource during periods when the capacity reserve constraint is binding (e.g. accounting for forced outages during supply constrained periods) and is similar to derating factors used in the capacity markets. On top of the flexible demand resources, load curtailment can also provide capacity (i.e., demand response or load management). We allow all segments of voluntary load curtailment, s geq 2 in S, to contribute to capacity requirements. The first segment s = 1 in S corresponds to involuntary demand curtailment or emergency load shedding at the price cap or value of lost load, and thus does not contribute to reserve requirements.

By definition, power flows leaving their reference zone are positive, thus the minus sign is used for this term. Losses due to power flows increase demand, and one-half of losses across a line linking two zones are attributed to each connected zone. The losses function beta_lt(cdot) will depend on the configuration used to model losses (see below). Accounting for Transmission and Network Expansion Between Zones Transmission flow constraints are modeled using a 'transport method','' where power flow, Phi_lt, on each line (or more likely a `path' aggregating flows across multiple parallel lines) is constrained to be less than or equal to the line's maximum power transfer capacity, varphi^max_l, plus any transmission capacity added on that line (for lines eligible for expansion in the set mathcalE). The additional transmission capacity, bigtriangleupvarphi^max_l  is constrained by a maximum allowed reinforcement overlinebigtriangleupvarphi^max_l, for each line l in mathcalE.\n\nbeginaligned\n\t trasmission constraints\n\t-varphi^max_l leq  Phi_lt leq varphi^max_l  quad forall l in (mathcalL setminus mathcalE )forall t  in mathcalT\n\t trasmission expansion\n\t-(varphi^max_l + bigtriangleupvarphi^max_l ) leq  Phi_lt leq (varphi^max_l + bigtriangleupvarphi^max_l )  quad forall l in mathcalEforall t  in mathcalT\n\t bigtriangleupvarphi^max_l  leq overlinebigtriangleupvarphi^max_l quad forall l in mathcalE\nendaligned\n\nAccounting for Transmission Losses Transmission losses due to power flows can be accounted for in three different ways. The first option is to neglect losses entirely, setting the value of the losses function to zero for all lines at all hours. The second option is to assume that losses are a fixed percentage, varphi^loss_l, of the magnitude of power flow on each line, mid Phi_lt mid (e.g., losses are a linear function of power flows). Finally, the third option is to calculate losses, ell_lt, by approximating a quadratic-loss function of power flow across the line using a piecewise-linear function with total number of segments equal to the size of the set mathcalM.\n\nbeginaligned\nconfigurable losses formulation\n\t beta_lt(cdot) = begincases 0  textif textlosses0   varphi^loss_ltimes mid Phi_lt mid  textif textlosses1   ell_lt textif textlosses2 endcases quad forall l in mathcalLforall t  in mathcalT\nendaligned\n\nFor the second option, an absolute value approximation is utilized to calculate the magnitude of the power flow on each line (reflecting the fact that negative power flows for a line linking nodes i and j represents flows from node j to i and causes the same magnitude of losses as an equal power flow from i to j). This absolute value function is linearized such that the flow in the line must be equal to the subtraction of the auxiliary variable for flow in the positive direction, Phi^+_lt, and the auxiliary variable for flow in the negative direction, Phi^+_lt, of the line. Then, the magnitude of the flow is calculated as the sum of the two auxiliary variables. The sum of positive and negative directional flows are also constrained by the maximum line flow capacity.\n\nbeginaligned\n trasmission losses simple\n\tPhi_lt =  Phi^+_lt  - Phi^-_lt quad forall l in mathcalL forall t  in mathcalT\n\tmid Phi_lt mid =  Phi^+_lt  + Phi^-_lt quad forall l in mathcalL forall t  in mathcalT\n\tPhi^+_lt  + Phi^-_lt leq varphi^max_l quad forall l in mathcalL forall t  in mathcalT\nendaligned\n\nIf discrete unit commitment decisions are modeled, ``phantom losses'' can be observed wherein the auxiliary variables for flows in both directions (Phi^+_lt and Phi^-_lt) are both increased to produce increased losses so as to avoid cycling a thermal generator and incurring start-up costs or opportunity costs related to minimum down times. This unrealistic behavior can be eliminated via inclusion of additional constraints and a set of auxiliary binary variables, ON^+_lt in 01 forall l in mathcalL. Then the following additional constraints are created:\n\nbeginaligned\n\tPhi^+_lt leq TransON^+_lt  quad forall l in mathcalL forall t  in mathcalT\n\tPhi^-_lt leq (varphi^max_l + bigtriangleupvarphi^max_l) -TransON^+_lt quad  forall l in mathcalL forall t  in mathcalT\nendaligned\n\nwhere TransON^+_lt is a continuous variable, representing the product of the binary variable ON^+_lt and the expression, (varphi^max_l + bigtriangleupvarphi^max_l). This product cannot be defined explicitly, since it will lead to a bilinear expression involving two variables. Instead, we enforce this definition via the Glover's Linearization as shown below (also referred McCormick Envelopes constraints for bilinear expressions, which is exact when one of the variables is binary).\n\nbeginaligned\n\tTransON^+_lt leq  (varphi^max_l + overlinebigtriangleupvarphi^max_l) times TransON^+_lt  quad forall l in mathcalL forall t  in mathcalT \n\tTransON^+_lt leq  (varphi^max_l + bigtriangleupvarphi^max_l)  quad forall l in mathcalL forall t  in mathcalT \n\tTransON^+_lt leq (varphi^max_l + bigtriangleupvarphi^max_l) - (varphi^max_l + overlinebigtriangleupvarphi^max_l) times(1- TransON^+_lt)  quad forall l in mathcalL forall t  in mathcalT \nendaligned\n\nThese constraints permit only the positive or negative auxiliary flow variables to be non-zero at a given time period, not both. For the third option, losses are calculated as a piecewise-linear approximation of a quadratic function of power flows. In order to do this, we represent the absolute value of the line flow variable by the sum of positive stepwise flow variables (mathcalS^+_mlt mathcalS^-_mlt), associated with each partition of line losses computed using the corresponding linear expressions. This can be understood as a segmentwise linear fitting (or first order approximation) of the quadratic losses function. The first constraint below computes the losses a the accumulated sum of losses for each linear stepwise segment of the approximated quadratic function, including both positive domain and negative domain segments. A second constraint ensures that the stepwise variables do not exceed the maximum size per segment. The slope and maximum size for each segment are calculated as per the method in \\cite{Zhang2013}.\n\nbeginaligned\n\t ell_lt = fracvarphi^ohm_l(varphi^volt_l)^2bigg( sum_m in mathcalM( S^+_mltimes mathcalS^+_mlt + S^-_mltimes mathcalS^-_mlt) bigg) quad forall l in mathcalL forall t  in mathcalT \n\t textquad Where \n\t quad S^+_ml = frac2+4 times sqrt2times (m-1)1+sqrt2 times (2 times M-1) (varphi^max_l + overlinebigtriangleupvarphi^max_l) quad forall m in 1 colon M l in mathcalL  \n\t quad S^-_ml = frac2+4 times sqrt2times (m-1)1+sqrt2 times (2 times M-1) (varphi^max_l + overlinebigtriangleupvarphi^max_l) quad forall m in 1 colon M l in mathcalL\n\t \n\t mathcalS^+_mlt mathcalS^-_mlt = overlinemathcalS_ml quad forall m in 1M l in mathcalL t in mathcalT \n\t textquad Where \n\t quad overlineS_lz =  begincases frac(1+sqrt2)1+sqrt2 times (2 times M-1)  (varphi^max_l + overlinebigtriangleupvarphi^max_l)  textif m = 1 \n\tfrac2 times sqrt2 1+sqrt2 times (2 times M-1) (varphi^max_l + overlinebigtriangleupvarphi^max_l)  textif m  1 endcases\nendaligned\n\nNext, a constraint ensures that the sum of auxiliary segment variables (m geq 1) minus the \"zero\" segment (which allows values to go into the negative domain) from both positive and negative domains must total the actual power flow across the line, and a constraint ensures that the sum of negative and positive flows do not exceed the maximum flow for the line.\n\nbeginaligned\n\tsum_m in 1M (mathcalS^+_mlt) - mathcalS^+_0lt =  Phi_lt quad forall l in mathcalL forall t  in mathcalT\n\tsum_m in 1M (mathcalS^-_mlt) - mathcalS^-_0lt  =  - Phi_lt\nendaligned\n\nAs with losses option 2, this segment-wise approximation of a quadratic loss function also permits 'phantom losses' to avoid cycling thermal units when discrete unit commitment decisions are modeled. In this case, the additional constraints below are also added to ensure that auxiliary segments variables do not exceed maximum value per segment and that they are filled in order; i.e., one segment cannot be non-zero unless prior segment is at its maximum value. Binary constraints deal with absolute value of power flow on each line. If the flow is positive, mathcalS^+_0lt must be zero; if flow is negative, mathcalS^+_0lt must be positive and takes on value of the full negative flow, forcing all mathcalS^+_mlt other segments (m geq 1) to be zero. Conversely, if the flow is negative, mathcalS^-_0lt must be zero; if flow is positive, mathcalS^-_0lt must be positive and takes on value of the full positive flow, forcing all mathcalS^-_mlt other segments (m geq 1) to be zero. Requiring segments to fill in sequential order and binary variables to ensure variables reflect the actual direction of power flows are both necessary to eliminate ``phantom losses'' from the solution.

Storage with symmetric charge and discharge capacity For storage technologies with symmetric charge and discharge capacity (all o in mathcalO^sym), charge rate, Pi_ozt, is constrained by the total installed power capacity, Omega_oz. Since storage resources generally represent a `cluster' of multiple similar storage devices of the same type/cost in the same zone, GenX permits storage resources to simultaneously charge and discharge (as some units could be charging while others discharge), with the simultaenous sum of charge, Pi_ozt, and discharge, Theta_ozt, also limited by the total installed power capacity, Delta^total_oz. These two constraints are as follows:\n\nbeginaligned\n\t  Pi_ozt leq Delta^total_oz  quad forall o in mathcalO^sym z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT\n\t  Pi_ozt + Theta_ozt leq Delta^total_oz  quad forall o in mathcalO^sym z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT\nendaligned\n\nThese constraints are created with the function storage_symmetric!() in storage_symmetric.jl. If reserves are modeled, the following two constraints replace those above:\n\nbeginaligned\n  Pi_ozt + f^charge_ozt leq Delta^total_oz  quad forall o in mathcalO^sym z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT\n  Pi_ozt + f^charge_ozt + Theta_ozt + f^discharge_ozt + r^discharge_ozt leq Delta^total_oz  quad forall o in mathcalO^sym z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT \nendaligned\n\nwhere f^charge_ozt is the contribution of storage resources to frequency regulation while charging, f^discharge_ozt is the contribution of storage resources to frequency regulation while discharging, and r^discharge_ozt is the contribution of storage resources to upward reserves while discharging. Note that as storage resources can contribute to regulation and reserves while either charging or discharging, the proxy variables f^charge_ozt f^discharge_ozt and r^charge_ozt r^discharge_ozt are created for storage resources where the total contribution to regulation and reserves, f_ozt r_ozt is the sum of the proxy variables. These constraints are created with the function storage_symmetric_reserves!() in storage_symmetric.jl. Storage with asymmetric charge and discharge capacity For storage technologies with asymmetric charge and discharge capacities (all o in mathcalO^asym), charge rate, Pi_ozt, is constrained by the total installed charge capacity, Delta^total charge_oz, as follows:\n\nbeginaligned\n\t  Pi_ozt leq Delta^total charge_oz  quad forall o in mathcalO^asym z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT\nendaligned\n\nThese constraints are created with the function storage_asymmetric() in storage_asymmetric.jl. If reserves are modeled, the above constraint is replaced by the following:\n\nbeginaligned\n\t  Pi_ozt + f^charge_ozt leq Delta^total charge_oz  quad forall o in mathcalO^asym z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT\nendaligned\n\nwhere f^+_y=ozt is the contribution of storage resources to frequency regulation while charging. These constraints are created with the function storage_asymmetric_reserves() in storage_asymmetric.jl. All storage resources The following constraints apply to all storage resources, o in mathcalO, regardless of whether the charge/discharge capacities are symmetric or asymmetric. The following two constraints track the state of charge of the storage resources at the end of each time period, relating the volume of energy stored at the end of the time period, Gamma_ozt, to the state of charge at the end of the prior time period, Gamma_ozt-1, the charge and discharge decisions in the current time period, Pi_ozt Theta_ozt, and the self discharge rate for the storage resource (if any), eta_oz^loss.  The first of these two constraints enforces storage inventory balance for interior time steps (t in mathcalT^interior), while the second enforces storage balance constraint for the initial time step (t in mathcalT^start).\n\nbeginaligned\n\t  Gamma_ozt =Gamma_ozt-1 - frac1eta_oz^dischargeTheta_ozt + eta_oz^chargePi_ozt - eta_oz^lossGamma_ozt-1  quad forall o in mathcalO z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT^interior\n\t  Gamma_ozt =Gamma_ozt+tau^period-1 - frac1eta_oz^dischargeTheta_ozt + eta_oz^chargePi_ozt - eta_oz^lossGamma_ozt+tau^period-1  quad forall o in mathcalO z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT^start\nendaligned\n\nWhen modeling the entire year as a single chronological period with total number of time steps of tau^period, storage inventory in the first time step is linked to storage inventory at the last time step of the period representing the year. Alternatively, when modeling the entire year with multiple representative periods, this constraint relates storage inventory in the first timestep of the representative period with the inventory at the last time step of the representative period, where each representative period is made of tau^period time steps. In this implementation, energy exchange between representative periods is not permitted. When modeling representative time periods, GenX enables modeling of long duration energy storage which tracks state of charge between representative periods enable energy to be moved throughout the year. If there is more than one representative period and LDS has been enabled for resources in Generators.csv, this function calls long_duration_storage() in long_duration_storage.jl to enable this feature. The next constraint limits the volume of energy stored at any time, Gamma_ozt, to be less than the installed energy storage capacity, Delta^total energy_oz. Finally, the maximum discharge rate for storage resources, Pi_ozt, is constrained to be less than the discharge power capacity, Omega_ozt or the state of charge at the end of the last period, Gamma_ozt-1, whichever is less.\n\nbeginaligned\n\t  Gamma_ozt leq Delta^total energy_oz  quad forall o in mathcalO z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT\n\t  Theta_ozt leq Delta^total_oz  quad forall o in mathcalO z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT\n\t  Theta_ozt leq Gamma_ozt-1  quad forall o in mathcalO z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT\nendaligned\n\nThe above constraints are established in storage_all!() in storage_all.jl. If reserves are modeled, two pairs of proxy variables f^charge_ozt f^discharge_ozt and r^charge_ozt r^discharge_ozt are created for storage resources, to denote the contribution of storage resources to regulation or reserves while charging or discharging, respectively. The total contribution to regulation and reserves, f_ozt r_ozt is then the sum of the proxy variables:\n\nbeginaligned\n\t  f_ozt = f^charge_ozt + f^dicharge_ozt  quad forall o in mathcalO z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT\n\t  r_ozt = r^charge_ozt + r^dicharge_ozt  quad forall o in mathcalO z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT\nendaligned\n\nThe total storage contribution to frequency regulation (f_ozt) and reserves (r_ozt) are each limited specified fraction of installed discharge power capacity (upsilon^reg_yz upsilon^rsv_yz), reflecting the maximum ramp rate for the storage resource in whatever time interval defines the requisite response time for the regulation or reserve products (e.g., 5 mins or 15 mins or 30 mins). These response times differ by system operator and reserve product, and so the user should define these parameters in a self-consistent way for whatever system context they are modeling.\n\nbeginaligned\n\tf_yzt leq upsilon^reg_yz times Delta^total_yz\n\thspace4 cm  forall y in mathcalW z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT \n\tr_yz t leq upsilon^rsv_yztimes Delta^total_yz\n\thspace4 cm  forall y in mathcalW z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT\n\tendaligned\n\nWhen charging, reducing the charge rate is contributing to upwards reserve and frequency regulation as it drops net demand. As such, the sum of the charge rate plus contribution to regulation and reserves up must be greater than zero. Additionally, the discharge rate plus the contribution to regulation must be greater than zero.\n\nbeginaligned\n\t  Pi_ozt - f^charge_ozt - r^charge_ozt geq 0  quad forall o in mathcalO z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT\n\t  Theta_ozt - f^discharge_ozt geq 0  quad forall o in mathcalO z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT\nendaligned\n\nAdditionally, when reserves are modeled, the maximum charge rate and contribution to regulation while charging can be no greater than the available energy storage capacity, or the difference between the total energy storage capacity, Delta^total energy_oz, and the state of charge at the end of the previous time period, Gamma_ozt-1, while accounting for charging losses eta_oz^charge. Note that for storage to contribute to reserves down while charging, the storage device must be capable of increasing the charge rate (which increase net load).\n\nbeginaligned\n\t  eta_oz^charge times (Pi_ozt + f^charge_ozt) leq Delta^energy total_oz - Gamma_ozt-1  quad forall o in mathcalO z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT\nendaligned\n\nFinally, the constraints on maximum discharge rate are replaced by the following, to account for capacity contributed to regulation and reserves:\n\nbeginaligned\n\t  Theta_ozt + f^discharge_ozt + r^discharge_ozt leq Delta^total_oz  quad forall o in mathcalO z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT\n\t  Theta_ozt + f^discharge_ozt + r^discharge_ozt leq Gamma_ozt-1  quad forall o in mathcalO z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT\nendaligned\n\nThe above reserve related constraints are established by storage_all_reserves!() in storage_all.jl\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"storage.html#GenX.write_storage-Tuple{AbstractString, Dict, Dict,

Hydroelectric generators with water storage reservoirs (y in mathcalW) are effectively modeled as energy storage devices that cannot charge from the grid and instead receive exogenous inflows to their storage reservoirs, reflecting stream flow inputs. For resources with unknown reservoir capacity (y in mathcalW^nocap), their operation is parametrized by their generation efficiency, eta_yz^down, and energy inflows to the reservoir at every time-step, represented as a fraction of the total power capacity,(rho^max_yzt).  In case reservoir capacity is known (y in mathcalW^cap), an additional parameter, mu^stor_yz, referring to the ratio of energy capacity to discharge power capacity, is used to define the available reservoir storage capacity. Storage inventory balance Reservoir hydro systems are governed by the storage inventory balance constraint given below. This constraint enforces that energy level of the reservoir resource y and zone z in time step t (Gamma_yzt) is defined as the sum of the reservoir level in the previous time step, less the amount of electricity generated, Theta_yzt (accounting for the generation efficiency, eta_yz^down), minus any spillage varrho_yzt, plus the hourly inflows into the reservoir (equal to the installed reservoir discharged capacity times the normalized hourly inflow parameter rho^max_yz t).\n\nbeginaligned\nGamma_yzt = Gamma_yzt-1 -frac1eta_yz^downTheta_yzt - varrho_yzt + rho^max_yzt times Delta^total_yz  hspace1 cm  forall y in mathcalW z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT^interior \nGamma_yzt = Gamma_yzt+tau^period-1 -frac1eta_yz^downTheta_yzt - varrho_yzt + rho^max_yzt times Delta^total_yz  hspace1 cm  forall y in mathcalW z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT^start\nendaligned\n\nWe implement time-wrapping to endogenize the definition of the intial state prior to the first period with the following assumption. If time step t is the first time step of the year then storage inventory at t is defined based on last time step of the year. Alternatively, if time step t is the first time step of a representative period, then storage inventory at t is defined based on the last time step of the representative period. Thus, when using representative periods, the storage balance constraint for hydro resources does not allow for energy exchange between representative periods. Note: in future updates, an option to model hydro resources with large reservoirs that can transfer energy across sample periods will be implemented, similar to the functions for modeling long duration energy storage in long_duration_storage.jl. Ramping Limits The following constraints enforce hourly changes in power output (ramps down and ramps up) to be less than the maximum ramp rates (kappa^down_yz and kappa^up_yz ) in per unit terms times the total installed capacity of technology y (Delta^total_yz).\n\nbeginaligned\nTheta_yzt + f_yzt + r_yzt - Theta_yzt-1 - f_yzt-1 leq kappa^up_yz times Delta^total_yz\nhspace2 cm  forall y in mathcalW z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT\nendaligned\n\nbeginaligned\nTheta_yzt-1 + f_yzt-1  + r_yzt-1 - Theta_yzt - f_yztleq kappa^down_yz Delta^total_yz\nhspace2 cm  forall y in mathcalW z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT\nendaligned\n\nRamping constraints are enforced for all time steps except the first time step of the year or first time of each representative period when using representative periods to model grid operations. Power generation and stream flow bounds Electricity production plus total spilled power from hydro resources is constrained to always be above a minimum output parameter, rho^min_yz, to represent operational constraints related to minimum stream flows or other demands for water from hydro reservoirs. Electricity production is constrained by either the the net installed capacity or by the energy level in the reservoir in the prior time step, whichever is more binding. For the latter constraint, the constraint for the first time step of the year (or the first time step of each representative period) is implemented based on energy storage level in last time step of the year (or last time step of each representative period).\n\nbeginaligned\nTheta_yzt + varrho_yzt  geq rho^min_yz times Delta^total_yz\nhspace2 cm  forall y in mathcalW z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT\nendaligned\n\nbeginaligned\nTheta_yt  leq times Delta^total_yz\nhspace4 cm  forall y in mathcalW z in mathcalZ tin mathcalT\nendaligned\n\nbeginaligned\nTheta_yzt leq  Gamma_yt-1\nhspace4 cm  forall y in mathcalW z in mathcalZ tin mathcalT\nendaligned\n\nReservoir energy capacity constraint In case the reservoir capacity is known (y in W^cap), then an additional constraint enforces the total stored energy in each time step to be less than or equal to the available reservoir capacity.
